# AI Factory

> **Stop configuring. Start building.**

You want to build with AI, but setting up the right context, prompts, and workflows takes time. AI Factory handles all of that so you can focus on what matters — shipping quality code.

**One command. Full AI-powered development environment.**

```bash
ai-factory init
```

---

## Why AI Factory?

- **Zero configuration** — detects your stack, installs relevant skills, configures integrations
- **Best practices built-in** — logging, commits, code review, all following industry standards
- **Spec-driven development** — AI follows plans, not random exploration. Predictable, resumable, reviewable
- **Community skills** — leverage [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) ecosystem or generate custom skills
- **Works with your stack** — Next.js, Laravel, Django, Express, and more
- **Multi-agent support** — Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Roo Code, Kilo Code, Antigravity, OpenCode, Warp, Zencoder, Codex CLI, GitHub Copilot, Gemini CLI, Junie, or [any agent](docs/getting-started.md#supported-agents)

---

## Installation

### Using npm
```bash
npm install -g ai-factory
```

### Using mise
```bash
mise use -g npm:ai-factory
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# In your project directory
ai-factory init
```

This will:
- Ask which AI agent you use
- Detect your project stack
- Install relevant skills
- Configure MCP servers (for supported agents)

Then open your AI agent and start working:

```
/ai-factory
```


## Usage

If the package is installed:
```bash
ai-factory init
```

Or running without installation via `npx`:
```bash
npx ai-factory init
```

### Example Workflow

```bash
# Plan a feature — creates branch, analyzes codebase, builds step-by-step plan
/ai-factory.feature Add user authentication with OAuth

# Optionally refine the plan with deeper analysis
/ai-factory.improve

# Execute the plan — implements tasks one by one, commits at checkpoints
/ai-factory.implement

# Fix a bug — AI learns from every fix and gets smarter over time
/ai-factory.fix TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of undefined

# Set up CI pipeline — GitHub Actions or GitLab CI with linting, SA, tests
/ai-factory.ci github

# Generate project documentation — README + docs/ with topics
/ai-factory.docs
```

See the full [Development Workflow](docs/workflow.md) with diagram and decision table.

### Auto-Generated Documentation

AI Factory can generate and maintain your project docs with a single command:

```bash
/ai-factory.docs          # Creates README + docs/ structure from your codebase
/ai-factory.docs --web    # Also generates a static HTML documentation site
```

- **Generates docs from scratch** — analyzes your codebase and creates a lean README + detailed `docs/` pages by topic
- **Cleans up scattered files** — finds loose CONTRIBUTING.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, SETUP.md in your root and consolidates them into a structured `docs/` directory
- **Keeps docs in sync** — integrates with `/ai-factory.implement` so documentation is updated automatically after each feature
- **Builds a docs website** — `--web` generates a static HTML site with navigation and dark mode, ready to host
